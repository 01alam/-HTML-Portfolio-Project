<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Mahtab Alam — a passionate web development enthusiast based in the vibrant city of Lucknow.</p><p> Currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA), I spend most of my days diving deep into the world of code, design, and digital creativity.</p>

<p>I believe the web is not just a place of information—it's a canvas.</p><p> With every line of HTML and every stroke of CSS, I aim to build experiences that are both functional and beautiful.</p><p> From responsive websites to dynamic web apps, I'm constantly experimenting, learning, and growing.</p>

<p>Alongside web development, I also have a keen interest in video editing, which allows me to express ideas visually and tell stories in motion.</p><p> My long-term goal is to explore the realms of AI and machine learning, but for now, I’m sharpening my skills and building a strong foundation in development and design.</p>

<p>Whether I’m designing an elegant layout, optimizing user experience, or exploring the newest frameworks, I always code with curiosity and create with heart.</p>

<p>Let’s build something great together.</p>
